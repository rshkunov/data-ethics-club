## Discussion
Each week, we split into breakout rooms of 4-6 people to discuss the material. 
Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!

### Discussion

#### Suggested Questions

- In what circumstances is it ethical for publicly available data (e.g. from social media, Google maps) or leaked or hacked data to be used to create intelligence reports?
- How reliable are the kinds of social media data that Bellingcat are using? Could digital evidence be faked or planted?
- What are the implications of police departments working with private investigators who use these methods?
- **Bonus Question:** What change would you like to see on the basis of this piece? Who has the power to make that change?

#### Room 1

General thoughts
- possible confusion or conflation of terms: private/ commercial? espionage/ citizen journalism? 
- are these terms merged on purpose or accident?

##### Q1
- inference from social media has different legal implications
- might not be possible to come up at generalisable answer?
- would the distinction be between public vs hacked/leaked data? (with first ifnd being ok?)
- what about doxxing? is good/bad intention a key indicator?
- what do we exactly mean by intelligence report? espionage work? or any report which analyses 'raw' data
- example of Matt hancock as a case study of such?
- informed consent of what happens to your social media activity?
- tension between openness of the internet VS protection of the info flow
- to what extent do we need this fearmongering? maybe most people will use data in ok way?
- what about people being 'accidentally' malicious?

##### Q2
- takes a lot of effort to do it - unlikely to be a huge concern in the long term
- what is the 'digital' on this question - is this a new debate?
- big data increases the volume of this - bigger reach, more people, faster spread of info
- what do we mean by reliable? does this word imply that there is some objective truth? 

##### Q3
- how much impact does misinfo have in the larger scheme of things?
- unclear identity of bellingcat ? spies? journalists? activists?
- how do they really try to influence policy? what is their plan?
- policE is a different matter? a bit outside of our expertise

##### Bonus question
- people should be more suspicious of 'evidence' presented to them
- more research on why things go viral?

##### Misc

#### Room 2

##### Q1
- What's fair game? And in what circumstances? Does whether something is fair game change depending on the circumstances?
- Is the ethical issue with giving the tools or misuing the tools? If you restrict some bad guys then you restrict some good guys too. 
- Facebook the public bit, if someone hasn't resitrcted access then they are "fair game" in a sense but people don't consent to it because they just don't know. How much does an individual have to take responsibility for other people's snooping?
- Some things have been created out of malice and have been good and vice versa. We collect data for the good but what happens later. Sometimes we collect the wrong things for too long.
- Who is responsible for making sure data is used correctly? The collectors or the analysts?
- 

##### Q2
- Labelling how reliable data is important. Being honest about gaps in your data (explicit or otherwise).
- Proxy measures combined look really good but might not be accurate. The gaps are not being focussed on.
- Warrants are needed for law enforcement to monitor social media in the UK and then the chain of evidence has to be followed in the court of law. You lose this a bit as you cross borders.
- Worry that if you get a story that's good enough, you can line up the facts to make it look good.
- No such standards apply to private agencies. 
- However, Bellingcat's evidence has been used at the ICC to convinct Russia of shooting down Dutch aeroplane over Ukraine.
- Are they succeptible to viewing themselves as heroes?
- Sometimes as individuals we have more freedom to do things and we can avoid these restrictions.
- For example, someone tracked schools being closed down due to covid on social media. Something that wasn't being collected by the public sector.
- Human rights activisits being monitored for "civil unrest", containing them in these structures. But these structures are built around colonialism.
- Is CCTV redudant? Sometimes connections still don't pan out. Maybe we have too much data/don't do anything with it.
- 
##### Q3
- Evidence comes from people. Police don't always have the resources/ability to collect information. So if someone else has collected it (even just witness statements), it should still be admissable (as long as it's verifiable).
- What happens if the evidence is admissable in one country but not the other?
- If vigilantes obtain information in illegal ways, perhaps the police would have difficulty using that evidence. 
- If something obtained illegally is left on a train, can it then be admitted by someone who finds it. For how long after it's left?
- Law enforcement are in a difficult position. Reminds of paedophile hunters, setting up honeytraps.
- Is it different between first time offenders/repeat offenders?
- Pros and cons of the dark web?
- What's the difference between police outsourcing to Bellingcat/to other experts and using expert witnesses?
- Perhaps Bellingcat are just open source data analyst experts who can be consulted like private professionals (DNA experts etc.)
- How good are they at doing it? How reliable is it? How do people take it in court?
- If people take it as gospel in court and they're not reliable, that's bad. If people think it's rubbish and they are reliable, that's bad.
- How do we verify it? What standards can we hold them to?
- Trust and expert opinions come up as much. - - Maybe you can't trust people like Bellingcat, do they just go to the highest bidder? 
- Perhaps they aren't untrustworthy, but if they're creating stories (even if all the evidence is there), then that could be dangerous.
- Fake news travels faster than facts. Maybe they're telling stories that follow their confirmation bias. They're only humans.
- People don't like uncertainty. But them being really open (more open than some government organisations).
- 
##### Bonus question

##### Misc

#### Room 3

- Cecil Hotel (mystery netflix - fictional) with private/online sleuths
- Stealing government ministers - journalism can hold people to account (panama papers).
- Data breaches can have positive or negative impacts

- Bellingcat January 6th US stormed the capital - one person was fatally shot when storming the capital - and there was realtime social media trying to write narratives about that (framing as insurgents or not).
- When the Berlin wall came down, they found that there was something recording all phone calls between west and east germany - huge breach of privacy, but 
- Social engineering - Black hat - spying, phishing, hacking, etc - when is it A) legal and B) ethical?
- Accidental data breaches, open data (which user may or may not have intended to make public).
- Pandemic response, data protection - initial track and trace on paper in pubs and used for getting girls phone numbers. The phone helpline for people on the shielding list seemed like a scam because they couldn't call back and didn't have any way of proving it was secure.
- 

##### Q1
- Ethics is perceived as situational sometimes: is it ethical to publish "fake news" to get a less bad outcome? There are genuine circumstances in which news lies to save lives.
- If you have an article in the NYT and you say it was sunny, you have to prove it with a weather report
- "facts" and numbers can still be misleading, e.g. it's true that double-vaccinated people have gotten covid (data literacy)
    - The people who are really good at data literacy are conspiracy theorists 
- If digital literacy isn't a good defense against false news, then what is?
    - A wider context (read things you wouldn't usually)
- On bullshit: Once you remove "truth" as a meaningful thing, you

##### Q2
- Police deal with informants who might be lying.

- Planting false information:
    - Introduces an assymetry based on groups powers to control a narrative with disinformation. 
    - Different identities, networks of bots (partly user-controlled)
    - A high percentage of tweets are automated, but less accounts
