### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

Afterwards we tidy up these summaries and post them [on the website](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-ethics-club/contents/write_ups/write-ups.html).

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

### Discussion

#### Suggested Questions

- **Q1**: What information or knowledge are we missing in terms of environmental impact of technology that might help us to act on it?
- **Q2**: Who does this problem ‘belong to’?
- **Q3**: What can we do about it?


#### Room 1

##### Q1 
The energy impacts of video conferencing should not be minimised. Teams is apparently more energy heavy than Zoom (by 40%, just because Zoom's efficiency has been optimised). Virtual backgrounds (writes a virtual background user) use 6% more energy; turning off the camera cuts consumption to a third.

##### Q2
All of us. But there is an 'accountability gap' whereby attributing responsibility for, say, carbon emissions, to companies or to countries is hard and makes it harder to drive change. The quality of the data and information needs to improve.
Grassroots change and influence will matter, but that is likely to focus on small singular issues. Focus on the small may not get us where we need to be, nor nearly quick enough.

##### Q3
We need to change the personal norms and our degree of excitement with new tech. We need to delay our renewal of our personal IT equipment (even delaying by 6 months the acquisition of our next phone might have an impact), we could shrink the size and number of files that we store in the cloud. 
How do we shift the psychology around this? People feel that they lack agency and believe that they will struggle to make a change on their own. Leadership is needed.
Get the message out about the impacts that our consumer decisions have.

##### Bonus question

##### Misc
What about shifting the hardware sector to hardware as a service, just as software as shifted to software as a service?

#### Room 2

##### Q1
- A map of the internet: https://www.submarinecablemap.com/
- Internet cables are buried under the ocean floor apparently? Sounds pretty neat.
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/how_the_internet_works/
[2019 article](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html)
- Where is your vitual machine? It is a computer, that's over there. Until you realise the internet is a physical thing with physical components, you don't think about the resources. The cloud is actually a bunch of components somewhere.
- Can we blame it on the wording? The "cloud" Do we just not care because we can't/don't do the digging 
- You UPload to the cloud and DOWNload
- The internet is a series of tubes, not a truck you load everything on.
- This article makes us aware of what we don't know the impact of. Surely other stuff is getting mined but it's hard to find out more about it.
- https://anatomyof.ai/index.html
- Mining is a big industry (especially in Australia for example). Growing up telephone wires were very visible. Seems almost space age when new stuff pops up.
- We don't do a lot of extraction in the UK, oil and gas but not really coal mining.
- Japanese people donated electronic devices to be recycled for Olympic medals. How long until we have recylable mobile phones?
- Fixing apple products is a bummer.
- https://www.fairphone.com/en/
- Is my laptop still going to degrade in the same amount of time?
##### Q2
- How slippery of the slope is to asking where is coming from?
- It's impossible for individuals to comprehend the supply chain to lead to get food to our plate.
- I guess hardware and software people are quite separate but I don’t know if hardware people would know any better?
- Horse meat in burgers!
- One person can't make a canoe/pencil. Is this just part of the human condition?
- Do we need to regulate this somehow? If we are better at tracking this stuff with data science tools, are we better able to regulate it?
- If we had that kind of information, would that lead consumers to change anything?
- If we leave the market to fix things, will it fix it? NO!
- Everyone stop rinsing dishes before putting dishes in the dishwasher because that'll stop climate change.
- Stifling innovation = right wing extremist talk for "worker's rights"
- Make friends with a Tory MP then send them a text whenever there's a public procurement thing going on. 
- Fixing climate change is a bit like a terrible group project.

##### Q3
- Nope, individual action won't make any difference. Collectively we might be able to do something. 
- Actions like being vegetarian that many people take up could be easily offset by the single action of one individual or organisation (e.g. shooting billionaires into space)
- Making individual efforts also helps to offset the doom. 
- Democracy is also a solution that we can all contribute to (even though it feels like it doesn't make a difference)
- We'd like to say that we tried to save the earth, even if it's a bit of a lost cause. 
https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2021/08/would-extinction-be-so-bad
- The media also platform anti-climate change "scientists" and spokespeople. E.G. Boris Johnson's father being interviewed as an environmentalist by the BBC - inherent bias in the media. 
- Idea of "equal debate" is flawed. One person who believes racism exists, one who doesn't, for example.
- Epidemeologist vs a youtuber type thing
- What constitutes an expert?
- It's seen as negative when people change their minds, but acually that's a reflection of changing evidence (i.e. science...)

##### Bonus question

##### Misc

## Summary

Grp 1: 
Perspective 1: 
Bottom up and top down approaches are necessary. Protesting, voting and citizen action are important, but we also need regulators to get on board. E.G. carbon credits, 

Perspective 2: 
Next election is in 4 years. In that time most people will have replaced their phones or laptops - why not make better choices in that time? We don't need to cancel capitalism - we can use capitalism to our advantage for what it's good for - providing a free market. 
Public opinion is very powerful, and there's a lot of things we can do. David Attenborogh documentary changed a lot very quickly. 
As engineers and data scientists we can make different decisions - where we train our models, what types of models we make. 
Using a virtual background uses more energy, Teams is less efficient than Zoom.

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, we'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then we'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.

## Feedback on the format
Please feel free to leave us some notes below on how the discussion group went for you this time, positive or negative, and any suggestions to improve (you can always [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) instead). 
We do read these and make changes :sparkles:

<!--
Please ignore these grey bits of text at the bottom of our HackMD documents. These help us to quickly format the write-ups for the website.
-->

<!--
How to put a writeup on the website:
1. Go to the GitHub Site (https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club) and navigate to the `site>contents>write_ups` directory, and go inside the directory for the current year.
2. Above the file browser, on the right, choose the option `Add file > Create New File`, name the file `DD-MM-YY_writeup.md` (date of the Data Ethics Club meeting). 
3. Copy in the contents of the write up (click next to the `1` in GH which is indicating the first line of the file). Add the admonition code (in the comment below this one) just below the title, but before the rest of the write up and change the text accordingly. Put the attendees at the bottom of the write up.
4. IMPORTANT: to save, scroll down the the bottom and choose the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option (this is not the default). Name the new branch something relating to the write up, e.g. "PrivateSpies", then click "Propose New File"
5. You will be taken automatically to create a pull request. Write in any things that you'd like any particular feedback on, in the comments. Add Natalie or Nina as reviewers.
6. You then need to add the markdown document to the Table of Contents in the navigation bar by editing the `writeup.md` file ON THE BRANCH YOU JUST MADE. You can go to the branch you just made from the Pull Request page, as the Pull Request will say something like "NatalieTurlby wants to merge 1 commit into `main` from `YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`" (click YOUR_BRANCH_NAME). Alternatively, you can get to it by going to the homepage of the GH repository, and choosing from the dropdown menu on the left. Once you are on your branch, navigate to `site>contents>write_ups>write-ups.md`, choose "edit this file" (little pencil), add your new file's location, and commit changes with the "Commit directly to the YOUR_BRANCH_NAME branch".
7. All done! Comment here to let me know how these instructions worked out: https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/86

```{admonition} What's this? 
This is summary of Wednesday 28th July's Data Ethics Club discussion, where we spoke and wrote about the New Republic article [The Rise of Private Spies](https://newrepublic.com/article/161913/we-are-bellingcat-spooked-private-investigators) by Charlie Savage.
The summary was written by Huw Day, who tried to synthesise everyone's contributions to this document and the discussion. "We" = "someone at Data Ethics Club". 
Nina Di Cara and Natalie Thurlby helped with the final edit.
