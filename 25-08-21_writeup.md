### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

Afterwards we tidy up these summaries and post them [on the website](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-ethics-club/contents/write_ups/write-ups.html).

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

### Discussion

#### Suggested Questions

- When should informed consent be relevant to the collection of public data? Does it depend on the type of data (e.g. images of our faces, our tweets) or the purpose (profit, research)? Is it possible for people to have bad reasons for preferring privacy? Are there circumstances in which peoples wishes for privacy or anonymity in public data be purposefully diregarded?
- To what extent do you (dis)agree with the conclusions in "Implications for Practice and Design"?
- Are there any results in the paper that surprise you?
- **Bonus Question:** What change would you like to see on the basis of this piece? Who has the power to make that change?

#### Room 1

##### Q1
- A TOS agreement is not informed consent. Currently, TOS is specifically designed to encourage negligence in decision making.
- When you sign the TOS, do you realise you're giving away your data?
- How differently would people behave on Twitter if signing the TOS was closer to signing informed consent?
- If your data is being used, even if you're not going to be harmed, you need to give consent. TOS is not sufficient.
- Interesting from the point of view of the NHS, people try to avoid formal restrictive research ethics. *Terms of Service Vs Informed Consent Vs Service Audits*
- When is it ok to avoid consent for example NHS?
- When people enter the NHS, they have the natural expectaction that their data is used for optimisation. That's somehow easier than the twitter quagmire.
- You couldn't get more public than being on twitter. Is this a natural assumption? No. Individuals can control their 'visibility', but not necessarily their distribution.
- People's responses would change quite radically depending on the aim/goal of the research. Stuff that classified indivduals might be less popular than studies that just recorded number of tweets on certain topics.
- Should we have to curate our online presence? Is it too idealistic to want to be able to avoid this?
- What about the mass use of data? Can stuff anonymise it? Does this violate twitter TOS?
- You don't want to be in the position to protect people who speak with hate speech but if you get false positives, that could have negative consequences.
- When you sign the TOS, do you realise you're giving away your data?
- The article missed the potential for public education. How do we educate people on this?
- Also what about sharing other people's data? I.e. family/children etc. People find comfort in oversharing.
- Attributing quotes to people vs. keeping people anonymous. 
- How is this different from writing in the newspapers? Open twitter account is basically the same thing, putting stuff out there.
- If I (you?) write something down, you're now accountable for that, for or for worse. Where does the balance lie on accountability?
- The fact that you put a photo on twitter doesn't mean you consent to that photo/tweet to be published in the newspaper.
- Conor's children destroyed his kitchen doing a Joe Wick's workout, he tweeted a photo, the Daily Mail picked up on it.
- Difference between the reasonable expectation that something will be seen, different from it being used.
- Legal/ethical expectation between what someone might read and what see and what they might actually use. 
- Difference between different STEM disciplines (social sciences vs medical) and how they treat data. Repeatability vs confidentiality.
- Is this another cycle? Gathering info on other people. There were also personal sections in newspapers, but the response to that was arguably copyright laws.
- The balance to strike is between what we know we own and how we think it should be treated.
- Perhaps the scale is something to consider, but that doesn't excuse this.
- Who is not on twitter? It is an enticing dataset, but not the same as census
- Cautious of using Twitter as a source of data when e.g. conducting sentiment analysis on public messaging from NHS on Covid information

##### Q2
- Not a disagreement, but perhaps a gap: public education about the easy access to tweets

##### Q3

##### Bonus question

##### Misc

#### Room 2

Is Twitte scraping just lazy research? Chuck a load of tweets into linear regression soup and see what comes out. Perhaps instead we should weigh up the purposes of scraping that data versus the privacy implications - is it actually going to help someone or are you just exploring some inane question?

Is consent really feasible?

We need to think about how we talk about people we don't like. There might be extremists, 

#### Room 3
##### Q1

Journalists find and publish tweets often - do they ask for permission?

Paper 'Go Away': Participant Objections to Being Studied and the Ethics of Chatroom Research - researchers less likely to get kicked out the more people are in the chat room. The likelihood fell in half each time there were 13 more people involved.

There is a difference between what people perceive as their audience on Twitter 

Having a group conversation in the pub is possible - private and public at the same time. We imagine there is a virtual equivalent, but actually there isn't. 

People being worried about using their whole history - perhaps because it feels more personally targeted. And also feel it a greater intrusion if there is use of deleted tweets. Excluding tweets that are deleted post the scraping of data is a challenge and researchers may not attempt to do so.

There are lots of situations where privacy is good - people may speak up against government or political opinion, professional risk to your employment if you tweet about them. Then again people can use privacy to hide behind a psyudonym for hate speech and 

Twitter isn't really a safe space, it seems like a battle ground - people are being 'cancelled' over things taken out of context, which people are now pushing back against and saying there should be more context. 

Troll accounts specifically use the anonymity of twitter to abuse others.

GDPR is explicitly opt-in, and you have to know what your data is being used for. 

If Twitter has a blanket opt-in for research could this ever work? You probably wouldn't get opt in for people who use their accounts for hate speech.

## After this session
You have a week to add anything else that you'd like to to this document. 
After that, we'll try to make this document a little more cohesive, then we'll send a link around to the write up of the discussion in the next mailing list email.

## Feedback on the format
Please feel free to leave us some notes below on how the discussion group went for you this time, positive or negative, and any suggestions to improve (you can always [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) or fill in our [survey](https://us7.list-manage.com/survey?u=48bd2e5df74c466acb63f18d0&id=9d541e0964&attribution=false). instead). 

We do read these and make changes :sparkles:

<!--
Please ignore these grey bits of text at the bottom of our HackMD documents. These help us to quickly format the write-ups for the website.
-->

<!--
How to put a writeup on the website:
1. Go to the GitHub Site (https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club) and navigate to the `site>contents>write_ups` directory, and go inside the directory for the current year.
2. Above the file browser, on the right, choose the option `Add file > Create New File`, name the file `DD-MM-YY_writeup.md` (date of the Data Ethics Club meeting). 
3. Copy in the contents of the write up (click next to the `1` in GH which is indicating the first line of the file). Add the admonition code (in the comment below this one) just below the title, but before the rest of the write up and change the text accordingly. Put the attendees at the bottom of the write up.
4. IMPORTANT: to save, scroll down the the bottom and choose the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option (this is not the default). Name the new branch something relating to the write up, e.g. "PrivateSpies", then click "Propose New File"
5. You will be taken automatically to create a pull request. Write in any things that you'd like any particular feedback on, in the comments. Add Natalie or Nina as reviewers.
6. You then need to add the markdown document to the Table of Contents in the navigation bar by editing the `writeup.md` file ON THE BRANCH YOU JUST MADE. You can go to the branch you just made from the Pull Request page, as the Pull Request will say something like "NatalieTurlby wants to merge 1 commit into `main` from `YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`" (click YOUR_BRANCH_NAME). Alternatively, you can get to it by going to the homepage of the GH repository, and choosing from the dropdown menu on the left. Once you are on your branch, navigate to `site>contents>write_ups>write-ups.md`, choose "edit this file" (little pencil), add your new file's location, and commit changes with the "Commit directly to the YOUR_BRANCH_NAME branch".
7. All done! Comment here to let me know how these instructions worked out: https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/86

```{admonition} What's this? 
This is summary of Wednesday 28th July's Data Ethics Club discussion, where we spoke and wrote about the New Republic article [The Rise of Private Spies](https://newrepublic.com/article/161913/we-are-bellingcat-spooked-private-investigators) by Charlie Savage.
The summary was written by Huw Day, who tried to synthesise everyone's contributions to this document and the discussion. "We" = "someone at Data Ethics Club". 
Nina Di Cara and Natalie Thurlby helped with the final edit.
